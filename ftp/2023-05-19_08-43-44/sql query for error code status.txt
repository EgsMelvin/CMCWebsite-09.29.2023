SELECT date as Date, QUANTIZE(time, 3600) AS Hour, 
       sc-status as Status, count(*) AS ErrorCount
FROM   {filename} 
WHERE  sc-status >= 400 
GROUP BY date, hour, sc-status 
HAVING ErrorCount > 25
ORDER BY ErrorCount DESC



The result could something like this:

Date       Hour     Status ErrorCount
---------- -------- ------ ------
2009-07-24 18:00:00 404    187
2009-07-17 13:00:00 500    99
2009-07-21 21:00:00 404    80
